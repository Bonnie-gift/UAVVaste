# UAVVaste dataset

The UAVVaste dataset consists to date of 772 images and 3716 annotations. The main motivation for creation of the dataset was the lack of domain-specific data. The datasets that are widely used for object detection evaluation benchmarking. The dataset is made publicly available and is intended to be expanded.
